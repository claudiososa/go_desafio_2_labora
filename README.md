# Library Book Management System

### Update Status
To update the status of a book to either "available" or "borrowed", use the `updateStatus` function. Provide the new status and the title of the book to be updated.

### Delete Book
To delete a book from the collection, use the `deleteBook` function. Provide the title of the book to be deleted.
